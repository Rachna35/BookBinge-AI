# BookBinge-AI
A Project website based on 'AI book recommendation system'.

BookBinge AI is a simple, quiz-based book recommendation website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users find book suggestions by answering four multiple-choice questions. Based on their answers, the site displays personalized book recommendations along with options to buy or read them online. The project is fully frontend-based, requires no login or backend, and focuses on providing a fast, private, and user-friendly reading discovery experience.
